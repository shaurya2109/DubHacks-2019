# **HearNow**
###### We are always _hear_ for you.

## About
This is application is aimed to give ears to people who were not born with this gift. We are trying to bridge the gap that these people feel in the world with the help of our small contribution in the form of this application. We give our users the ability to be alerted every time they are being called, convert conversations with people to text, the ability to share and save these conversations, and even create an automated to-do list on the basis of their conversation. We implement this using Google Cloud's Speech to Text API and Firebase Storage to store the user's data.

## Implementation
We use fast, easy technology to implement our solution to help people with a hearing disability. We use Google Cloud's Speech to Text API to convert speech to text in real time. We use this to detect when the user's name is being called as well as to convert the person's conversations into a digital format. Finally, we also implemented the concept of a 'wake word' (i.e. the user's name) which would trigger the app to create a notification and vibrate the phone in order to aware the user that someone is calling him out.

## What's next for HearNow?
* Adding user-customizable names as wake-words to our app. The Porcupine API we currently use is a limited, open source version, with the full version requiring a paid license.
* We would like to add the functionality of storing conversation messages on the app for the users to review at any convenient time.
* Update real time Multi-lingual Speech-to-Text conversation to accommodate more people and thereby increase the app's accessibility.
* Furthermore, we aim to publish our app to multiple mobile platforms, including iOS.
